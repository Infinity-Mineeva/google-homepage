====================
 Project: HTML/CSS
====================

The purpose of this peoject is to test my basic HTML and CSS skills
learnt so far and use them to deconstruct and rebulid a simple
page.

The page chosen for this project is Google.ca's homepage.


======
v. 1.0
======

Update: April 11, 2020 -- Uploaded v. 1.0 of the HTML/CSS files. The Google homepage is currently a non-functional
site (just looks like Google's homepage when not logged in). 

Future updates will (hopefully) include the ability to actually do a live search and get actual
Search Results from Google.
